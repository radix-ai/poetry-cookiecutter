# Poetry Cookiecutter

A modern [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for scaffolding Python packages and apps.

## üçø Demo

See [My Package](https://github.com/radix-ai/my-package) for an example of a Python package and app that is scaffolded with this template.

Starting development in My Package is as easy as cloning the repository with `git clone git@github.com:radix-ai/my-package`, opening the cloned repository in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and then running <kbd>Ctrl/‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>‚áß</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> ‚Üí _Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container_ with VS Code's [Remote-Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) to start a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## ‚ú® Using

### Creating a new Python project

To create a new Python project with this template:
1. Install [Cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) in your [Python environment](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) with:
   ```sh
   pip install cruft
   ```
2. Create a new repository and clone it locally.
3. In the repository's parent directory, run:
   ```sh
   cruft create -f git@github.com:radix-ai/poetry-cookiecutter
   ```

### Updating your Python project

To update your Python project with the latest template:
1. Run `cruft update` to update your project with the latest template.
2. If any of the updates failed, resolve them by inspecting the generated `.rej` files.
