    - Enable _Use Docker Compose V2_ in Docker Desktop's preferences window.
    - If you are using Linux, you must [configure Docker and Docker Compose to use the BuildKit build system](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-buildkit/). On macOS and Windows, BuildKit is enabled by default in Docker Desktop.
1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [VS Code's Remote-Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Alternatively, install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

1. Clone this repository.
{%- if cookiecutter.private_package_repository_name %}
1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory that [Docker Compose reads](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/) to use Poetry's `auth.toml` file as a [build and run time secret](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#secrets-configuration-reference):
    ```sh
    # Linux
    POETRY_AUTH_TOML_PATH="~/.config/pypoetry/auth.toml"

    # macOS
    POETRY_AUTH_TOML_PATH="~/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/auth.toml"

    # Windows
    POETRY_AUTH_TOML_PATH="$APPDATA/pypoetry/auth.toml"
    ```
{%- endif %}
1. Start a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) in your preferred development environment:
    - _VS Code_: open the cloned repository and run <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> → _Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container_.
    - _PyCharm_: open the cloned repository and [configure Docker Compose as a remote interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-compose-as-a-remote-interpreter.html#docker-compose-remote).
    - _Terminal_: open the cloned repository and run `docker compose run --rm dev` to start an interactive Dev Container.
